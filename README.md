This is a rails app to create and manage todo lists belonging to different campaigns. There are two types of users: experts and novices. Everyone can sign-up as a novice. Experts can change the status and type of novices.

Campaigns have a title, a duration in minutes and can be commented. Each campaign can have several todo lists. On todo lists, each item added by a novice can be commented.

For the start, run the seed file to create an expert and a beginner user.
